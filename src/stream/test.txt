Editor's notes: Beijing will become the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing 2022 can set a new benchmark for a sustainable Olympic Games,
on the one hand benefiting from the legacy of the Beijing 2008 Olympic
Games and on the other developing a new winter sports destination in a sustainable way.
